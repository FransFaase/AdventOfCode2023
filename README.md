### Sunday, December 3, 2022

At was only at the end of the afternoon, at 17:21, that I
started to work on the puzzle. I stated with writing some
generic code. I solved both puzzles at 19:03 but also had
dinner in between.

See further [Day 3](Day03.md).

I have added the generic code and some other standard
definition to the file [Std.md](Std.md).

### Monday, December 4, 2022

I read the puzzle text in the morning, before I went to the
office, but only started working on it at 18:44. I solved
both puzzles in about 70 minutes.

See further [Day 4](Day04.md).

### Tuesday, December 5, 2022

I solved the first part in the morning. The second part
took me a big part of the evening to solve. Also watched
some television in between. Looking at my rank for the
second part and the number of people who only solved ths
first part, it looks like this is really a hard puzzle.

I started reading the puzzle aroung 8:45 and started coding
around 9:00 and finished within half an hour.
