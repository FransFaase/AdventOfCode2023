# AdventOfCode2023

My effort of the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) contest
All times are for Central European Timezone (CTE).

### Friday, December 1, 2022

I woke up at 7:23 got up and started working at 7:50.

See further [Day 1](Day01.md).

### Saturday, December 2, 2022

I started ag 8:37 and took until 9:29 to finish the first
part of the puzzle. The second part, I did between 18:27 and 18:35.

See further [Day 2](Day02.md).

### Sunday, December 3, 2022

At was only at the end of the afternoon, at 17:21, that I
started to work on the puzzle. I stated with writing some
generic code. I solved both puzzles at 19:03 but also had
dinner in between.

See further [Day 3](Day03.md).

I have added the generic code and some other standard
definition to the file [Std.md](Std.md).

### Monday, December 4, 2022

I read the puzzle text in the morning, before I went to the
office, but only started working on it at 18:44. I solved
both puzzles in about 70 minutes.

See further [Day 4](Day04.md).

### Tuesday, December 5, 2022

I solved the first part in the morning. The second part
took me a big part of the evening to solve. Also watched
some television in between. Looking at my rank for the
second part and the number of people who only solved ths
first part, it looks like this is really a hard puzzle.

See further [Day 5](Day05.md).

### Wednesday, December 6, 2022

I started reading the puzzle aroung 8:45 and started coding
around 9:00 and finished within half an hour.

See further [Day 6](Day06.md).

### Thursday, December 7, 2022

I did a bit in the morning, but most in the evening. I almost
quite, because a correct answer for the first part of the
puzzle was rejected because I gave some answers too quickly
after eachother. Thinking that you made an error your solution,
while there is no error and then going over your code, reading
the puzzle description, checking everything over and over again,
really can drive you crazy. I hope I remember the next time
this happens that an answer can be rejected even it was correct.

See further [Day 7](Day07.md).

### Friday, December 8, 2022

I solved the first step in the morning in about half an hour
and also preparing my lunch. At 18:41, I started again and
fount the answer for the second half at 19:54.

See further [Day 8](Day08.md).

### Saturday, December 9, 2022

I started reading the puzzle at 8:41 and solved both parts
at 9:24. Second part of the puzzle was rather easy, having
some mathematical knowledge, and (for me) gave a much smaller
answer than the first half.

See further [Day 9](Day09.md).

### Sunday, December 10, 2022

I started reading the puzzle around 11:11 and spend until
15:05 to find the answer to the first half. Then I did some
other things, but did think a little bit about a solution
that used the area of a polygon. When I started coding at
13:39, I found the solution at 14:32 after also doing some
things at home in the mean time. Besides some minor bugs
with respect to `printf` arguments, I found the solution in
one try.

See further [Day 10](Day10.md).

### Monday, December 11, 2022

I started reading the puzzle at 7:44 and found the correct
answer for both parts of the puzzle at 9:04.

See further [Day 11](Day11.md).

### Tuesday, December 12, 2022

I started reading the puzzle around 8:20 and took me a long
time to get everything working during the day. Only at 21:16
in the evening did I find the solution for the second part.

See further [Day 12](Day12.md).

### Wednesday, December 13, 2022

I started reading the puzzle around 7:05 and finished both
parts at 7:46 without many problems.

See further [Day 13](Day13.md).

### Thursday, December 14, 2022

I started reading the puzzle around 7:35 and finished the
first half in one try at 8:18. Then I had to leave and it
was only in the evening, that I finished the second part.

See further [Day 14](Day14.md).

### Friday, December 15, 2022

I woke up at 5:53 and decided to get up at 5:57. I opened
my laptop at 6:01 and started reading the text. I solved both
parts of the puzzle at 6:37 with only having to fix some syntax
errors.

See further [Day 15](Day15.md).

### Saturday, December 16, 2022

At 9:55, I had a quick look at the puzzle. It was only
at 14:47, that I started working on the puzzle. I found
both answers without much problems at 15:33 and 16:04.

See further [Day 16](Day16.md).

### Sunday, December 17, 2022

I woke up at 5:25 from a dream. After staying in bed a bit more,
I decided to get up. I switched on my laptop and started at 6:02.
At 7:08, I found the answer to both halfs. The second half was
relatively easy to find.

See further [Day 17](Day17.md).

### Monday, December 18, 2022

I only started working at this at 13:54 and found both answers
at 14:32.

See further [Day 18](Day18.md).

### Tuesday, December 19, 2022

I started working a bit at 10:44 but then got busy with a lot
of other things and only continues at 1:12, December 20 to
find both solutions at 2:48.

See further [Day 19](Day19.md).

### Wednesday, December 20, 2022

A worked a bit on this at the beginning of the afternoon,
but only started working on it around 17:00. At 21:11, I found
the answer to the first half of the puzzle. At first, I thought that
the second half was easy, but it turned out that the brute force
method did not find an answer. After some puzzling and watching a
film on TV, I implemented some code to find the solution for the
second part of the puzzle at 2:51, December 21.

See further [Day 20](Day20.md).

### Thursday, December 21, 2022

I started reading the puzzle around 11:30 and thought a bit about it.
I started coding at 11:44 and at submitted the correct answer for
the first part at 11:56 and did a little bit on the second part.
I thought about it during the day, but was busy with other things.
It was only at 23:17 that I continued working on the second half.
That resulted in working through the night, being anoyed that I could
not find the right answer. I should have stopped earlier, but I guess
my pride (finish all puzzles within 24 hours) got the best of me.
At 5:59, December 22, I got a new idea based on the animation shown
in [A Diamond in the Rough](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/18njrqf/2023_day_21_a_diamond_in_the_rough/)
but I went to sleep before finishing it. At 13:30, I continued working
on it and figured out a method to calculate the answer. Still required
me several more tries due to small bugs and one time accidently
submitting an incorrect previous answer. But finally at 15:24,
I submitted the last and correct answer. I do not know if I will
spend time to figure out what was wrong with my earlier implementation.

See further [Day 21](Day21.md).

### Friday, December 22, 2022

At 15:16, I started reading the puzzle description. I wrestled a lot
with the first part. At 19:20, I found the solution for the first
part and at 19:54, the solution for the second part.

See further [Day 22](Day22.md).

### Saturday, December 23, 2022

I already guessed what would have been the second part of the puzzle
but still solved the first part building a graph. I did find the solution
for the second part, but with a bit of luck, because the program kept
on running quite long. I continued working on it a bit afterwards.
Implemented a cut-off, which seemed to make find the answer faster,
but it would still run on much longer. Only when I added some print
statements, I discovered a bug, which when fixed reduced the running
time to 60 miliseconds.

See [Day 23](Day22.md).
