# AdventOfCode2023

My effort of the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) contest
All times are for Central European Timezone (CTE).

### Friday, December 1, 2022

I woke up at 7:23 got up and started working at 7:50.

See further [Day 1](Day01.md).

### Saturday, December 2, 2022

I started ag 8:37 and took until 9:29 to finish the first
part of the puzzle. The second part, I did between 18:27 and 18:35.

See further [Day 2](Day02.md).

### Sunday, December 3, 2022

At was only at the end of the afternoon, at 17:21, that I
started to work on the puzzle. I stated with writing some
generic code. I solved both puzzles at 19:03 but also had
dinner in between.

See further [Day 3](Day03.md).

I have added the generic code and some other standard
definition to the file [Std.md](Std.md).

### Monday, December 4, 2022

I read the puzzle text in the morning, before I went to the
office, but only started working on it at 18:44. I solved
both puzzles in about 70 minutes.

See further [Day 4](Day04.md).

### Tuesday, December 5, 2022

I solved the first part in the morning. The second part
took me a big part of the evening to solve. Also watched
some television in between. Looking at my rank for the
second part and the number of people who only solved ths
first part, it looks like this is really a hard puzzle.

### Wednesday, December 6, 2022

I started reading the puzzle aroung 8:45 and started coding
around 9:00 and finished within half an hour.

See further [Day 6](Day06.md).

### Thursday, December 7, 2022

I did a bit in the morning, but most in the evening. I almost
quite, because a correct answer for the first part of the
puzzle was rejected because I gave some answers too quickly
after eachother. Thinking that you made an error your solution,
while there is no error and then going over your code, reading
the puzzle description, checking everything over and over again,
really can drive you crazy. I hope I remember the next time
this happens that an answer can be rejected even it was correct.

See further [Day 7](Day07.md).

### Friday, December 8, 2022

I solved the first step in the morning in about half an hour
and also preparing my lunch. At 18:41, I started again and
fount the answer for the second half at 19:54.

See further [Day 8](Day08.md).

### Saturday, December 9, 2022

I started reading the puzzle at 8:41 and solved both parts
at 9:24. Second part of the puzzle was rather easy, having
some mathematical knowledge, and (for me) gave a much smaller
answer than the first half.

See further [Day 9](Day09.md).

### Sunday, December 10, 2022

I started reading the puzzle around 11:11 and spend until
15:05 to find the answer to the first half. Then I did some
other things, but did think a little bit about a solution
that used the area of a polygon. When I started coding at
13:39, I found the solution at 14:32 after also doing some
things at home in the mean time. Besides some minor bugs
with respect to `printf` arguments, I found the solution in
one try.

See further [Day 10](Day10.md).

### Sunday, December 11, 2022

I started reading the puzzle at 7:44 and found the correct
answer for both parts of the puzzle at 9:04.
